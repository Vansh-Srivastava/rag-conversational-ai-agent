# 🤖 RAG-Powered Conversational AI Agent

An intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that combines semantic search, vector databases, and Large Language Models to deliver accurate, context-aware responses from custom knowledge sources.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that enhances AI responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating answers.

The system leverages Pinecone for vector storage, Google Gemini for response generation, and LangChain for orchestration. Buffer Window Memory is incorporated to maintain conversational context and improve multi-turn interactions.
